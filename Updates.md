Using a speaker and different hertz, I will observe how different hertz played by the speaker will effect the ripples in the water.

Current setup is a speaker is oriented upward and attached to a long cylinder right on top of it. The cylinder has a dip on the top that allows for a thin layer of water to be placed on the top. The cylinder and speaker is also held upright by a rectangular box. By connecting a computer to the speaker, I play different hertz and see the ripples on the top. 

Equations used:
Î» = v/f (v is speed of the surface of the water in m/s, f is the frequency in hertz)
v = Sqrt(g*h) (g is gravity in m/s^2, h is the depth of the water in m)

Setup has changed so that instead of the original rectangular box I used to hold the setup up, I used a smaller cube-shaped box to hold the speaker upright. Also, there is no longer a cylinder attached to the top of the speaker. Instead, I placed a 90mm petri dish directly on the speaker. However, the results slightly differ from the previous setup as the frequency at which the ripples get chaotic seem to be lower. This is likely due to how much energy and vibrations is actually coming from the speaker to the water.
